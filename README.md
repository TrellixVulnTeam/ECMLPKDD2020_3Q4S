## Title
Put Deep Learning to work: Accelerate Deep Learning through Amazon SageMaker and ML Services

## Abstract
Deploying deep learning (DL) projects are becoming increasingly more pervasive at enterprises and startups alike. At Amazon, Machine Learning University (MLU)-trained engineers are taking DL to every aspect of Amazon’s businesses, beyond just Amazon Go, Alexa, and Robotics.
In this workshop, Wenming Ye (AWS) and Rachel Hu (AWS) offer a practical next step in DL learning with instructions, and hands-on labs using the latest Nvidia GPUs and AWS Inferentia. You will explore the current trends powering AI/DL adoption, powerful new GPU/AWS Inferentia accelerator instances, distributed training and inference optimization in neural networks.
